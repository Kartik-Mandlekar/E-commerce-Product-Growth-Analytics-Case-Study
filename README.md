📌 Key Questions & Insights
🔹 Q1. Product refund performance
Question
Which products have the highest refund rates, and how does this relate to their sales volume?
Key Insight
•	Product 3 has the highest refund rate (~6%), indicating a potential product-quality or expectation mismatch issue.
•	Product 1 has a slightly lower refund rate (~5%) but contributes the largest absolute revenue loss due to its high sales volume.
•	This distinction highlights the difference between quality problems (high refund %) and scale problems (high absolute loss).
Product takeaway
Prioritize product 1 for financial impact reduction and product 3 for quality investigation.

🔹 Q5. Growth drivers over time
Question
Is revenue growth driven more by traffic growth or conversion improvement?
Key Insights
•	Conversion rate increased structurally from ~3% to ~8% over time, indicating strong funnel and product improvements.
•	Once conversion stabilized, month-to-month revenue volatility closely followed traffic changes.
•	This indicates a shift from optimization-led growth to acquisition-led growth.
Strategy takeaway
Future growth should focus on scaling high-quality acquisition channels rather than further conversion optimization.

🔹 Q6. Refund impact on profitability
Question
What is the revenue and profitability impact of refunds, and which products cause the most loss?
Key Metrics
•	Revenue loss = refunded amount
•	Profit loss = refunded amount − cost of goods
Key Insights
•	Product 1 causes the highest absolute profit loss (~$37K) due to scale.
•	Product 3 has the highest refund rate (~6%), signaling a quality issue.
•	Using both refund rate and absolute profit loss helps distinguish scale vs quality problems.
Business takeaway
Address high-volume refund products for immediate financial impact and high-refund-rate products for long-term quality improvement.
